rscripts
========

This is a collection of R scripts for my personal, research purposes. I make no claims about support or even documentation. If anyone chooses to use this, please do so at your own peril. I am not responsible for any unseemly outcome.


**kmeanssampler.R**: Simulate a 2D Gaussian Mixture Model, estimate k-means from it and plot results.

**testargs.R**: Script to read command line arguments into R scripts

**svm_viz.R**: Generating a toy GMM and applying SVM and visualizing it.
