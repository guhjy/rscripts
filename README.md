rscripts
========

This is a collection of R scripts for my personal, research purposes. I make no claims about support or even documentation. If anyone chooses to use this, please do so at your own peril. I am not responsible for any unseemly outcome.

**Brief Descriptions:**

**kmeanssampler.R**: Simulate a 2D Gaussian Mixture Model, estimate k-means from it and plot results.

**testargs.R**: Script to read command line arguments into R scripts

**svm_viz.R**: Generating a toy GMM and applying SVM and visualizing it.

**simple-sir.R**: Simulates and inspects a simple 3 variable compartmental model (SIR model) to model for social contagion

**pca-iris.R**: Uses Fisher's Iris Dataset to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and its diagnoistics.

**LMM_Examples.R**: A simple implementation of a linear mixed model. These types of models are also known as Hierarchical Linear Models or Random Effects Models.

**kmeans.R**: A script which takes example data from kmeans-data and then runs the kmeans algorithm on it. Easy and fast - can be modified for any simple dataset's purpose.

**structuralequation-examplemodels.R**: A script which fits a standard structural equation model on sample data (provided within the script)

**t-test-robustness.R**: A script which simulates some data and inspects the robustness of the standard 2 sample t-test.

**small-multiple-example.R**: Applies Tufte's small multiple principle to data analysis with many categories to make visualization and analysis simpler and more palatable. The example output is in small-multiple-example.png
**coin-fairness-bayesiantest.R**: A script which simulates a series of coin tosses and tests the hypothesis that the coin is a fair coin. 

**robust-regressions.R**: A script which performs robust multiple linear regression on data. This type of a regression is usually quite flexible from small departures from the usual assumptions.

**bayesian-sensitivityanalysis.R**: A script which takes some sample data and performs Bayesian sensitivity analysis on the results of an experiment. This is slightly different from the usual frequentist way of doing sensitivity analysis.

**proportion-comparing.R**: A script which makes up some fake data and statistically tests between 2 proportions from a bayesian perspective. This type of analysis is very quick, dirty and useful in hci research. 

**hierarchicalmodeling-bayesian.R**: A script which performs randomized hierarchical, bayesian modeling.
