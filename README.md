rscripts
========

This is a collection of R scripts for my personal, research purposes. I make no claims about support or even documentation. If anyone chooses to use this, please do so at your own peril. I am not responsible for any unseemly outcome.

**Brief Descriptions:**

**kmeanssampler.R**: Simulate a 2D Gaussian Mixture Model, estimate k-means from it and plot results.

**testargs.R**: Script to read command line arguments into R scripts

**svm_viz.R**: Generating a toy GMM and applying SVM and visualizing it.

**simple-sir.R**: Simulates and inspects a simple 3 variable compartmental model (SIR model) to model for social contagion

**pca-iris.R**: Uses Fisher's Iris Dataset to perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and its diagnoistics.

**LMM_Examples.R**: A simple implementation of a linear mixed model. These types of models are also known as Hierarchical Linear Models or Random Effects Models.

**kmeans.R**: A script which takes example data from kmeans-data and then runs the kmeans algorithm on it. Easy and fast - can be modified for any simple dataset's purpose.
